git-publish-branch(1)
=====================

Name
----
git-publish-branch - publish a branch to a remote repository

Synopsis
--------
git-publish-branch <branch>

Description
-----------

git-publish-branch is a simple script to ease the unnecessarily complex task of
"publishing" a branch, i.e., taking a local branch, creating a reference to it
on a remote repo, and setting up the local branch to track the remote one, all
in one go.

You give it a branch name, and that branch is published in your remote
repository. That's it. If you use -d, it will delete the remote reference.

Useful if you publish your topic branches to the outside world.
