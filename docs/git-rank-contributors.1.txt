git-rank-contributors(1)
========================

Name
----
git-rank-contributors - rank all authors by patch size

Synopsis
--------
git-rank-contributors [-v] [-o]

Description
-----------

git-rank-contributors is a trivial script that paws through your logs and ranks
all the contributors by the size of their diffs. As always, bigger is better!

This is similar to git shortlog -s -n --no-merges, but counts diff size rather
than number of commits.

Options
-------

  -v

Get the raw diff size.

  -o

Get high-tech email obfuscation.  Output with just -o may be suitable for piping
into a CREDITS file. It probably will require some editing in case people submit
from more than one email address, though.

Authors
-------

Author of git-rank-contributors is William Morgan <wmorgan-git-wt-add@masanjin.net>.

This manpage was written by Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>.
