Synopsis
--------
git-last [<branch>]

Description
-----------

git-wtf is a tool for working with feature branches. If you're on a feature
branch, it tells you which version branches it's merged into. If you're on a
version branch, it tells you which feature branches are merged in and which
aren't. For every branch, if it's a tracking branch, it tells you which commits
need to be pulled and which need to be pushed.

Use immediately after git fetch.
